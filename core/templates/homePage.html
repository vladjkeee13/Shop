            Berghaus Limited is an outdoor clothing and equipment manufacturer headquartered in Sunderland,
            Tyne & Wear, UK. It is based in the North East of England but distributes worldwide.
            It was founded in 1966 by climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, initially as an importer
            and distributor of outdoors products. Lockey and Davison's outdoor store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK,
            went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre. In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products
            for sale in their shop. They called their brand 'Berghaus' which is a literal translation of 'mountain house'
            in German.
